        Cannon Cup is an iOS game meant to simulate a modified version of beer pong. Rather than
        using the accelerometer that currently available beer pong simulators to approximate
        throwing a ball, I decided to add a stationary "cannon" that balls are shot from. After
        the cannon is set, red cups can be set randomly in the field ahead of the cannon. The
        cannon can then be aimed left or right by swiping, and then a shot charged by holding
        down the center. Making a cup makes it disappear!
