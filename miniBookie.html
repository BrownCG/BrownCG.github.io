        Mini-Bookie is a functioning RESTful API-based sportsbook backend. After creating a profile at
        <a ref="http://minibookie.wn.r.appspot.com">the landing page</a> using a Gmail account, users
        can create an event themselves or place a bet on an existing event. When created, an event is 
        given starting odds, a house cut or vig, and the maximum loss the house is willing to accept on
        the ticket. When a bet is placed, the potential payout is compared to make sure the house cannot
        lose more than its max loss; if accepted, the bet is created as an entry in a many-to-one 
        relationship with an event and the odds are automatically adjusted for future bets. Once all bets 
        are in, the game can be decided or cancelled. Cancelling the game through a DELETE call on the
        event causes all bets to be refunded and archived. Declaring a winner of the game through a PUT
        call causes all winning bets to be credited to those users with the bet status set to WIN, and 
        the losing bets to be set to LOSS.
