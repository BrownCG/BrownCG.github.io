        Oregone Airways was a partner project for my Databases courses at Oregon State University.
        It utilizes Javascript and MySQL to imitate a backend system for an airline flight reservation system. Flights
        are scheduled between destinations, upon which crew and passengers can be assigned to the plane. Git history can
        be found at www.github.com/browchr4/oregoneairways
